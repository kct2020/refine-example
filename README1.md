# refine-example
Simple example of custom pages

I don't want this in a folder. So I'm trying 
`npm -g create refine-app@latest -- --example with-custom-pages`
after renaming this file incase it gets overwritten.
But this doesn't work, so I'll just run local and move files
`npm create refine-app@latest -- --example with-custom-pages`
